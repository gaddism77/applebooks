Elif Shafak,The Island of Missing Trees,https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-island-of-missing-trees/id1571283566,https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication126/v4/8d/b2/94/8db2948a-4e99-1027-e416-1de5cb19328b/1034267102.jpg/400x700bb.jpg,"Fiction & Literature,Books","Set in Cyprus and London between 1974 and the late 2010s, Elif Shafak’s tale of star-crossed lovers is so captivating it feels almost magical at times. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that half of the novel is narrated by an exceptionally wise fig tree. <i>The Island of Missing Trees</i> tells the story of teenage sweethearts Kostas and Defne—he a Greek Christian, she a Turkish Muslim—and their ongoing struggles after leaving a divided postcolonial Cyprus. Shafak’s narrative sparkles with undercurrents of beauty and joy even as it explores themes of family, grief, and trauma. We especially adored the comic relief of Aunt Meryem, with her Marilyn Monroe–themed suitcases and her staunch unwillingness to mind her own business. This book is a profound celebration of love and the many ways that it endures across distance and time.",4.1,28
Kekla Magoon,Revolution in Our Time: The Black Panther Party’s Promise to the People,https://books.apple.com/us/book/revolution-in-our-time-the-black-panther-partys/id1574214141,https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication125/v4/59/a5/b4/59a5b4cc-9af8-3da4-1359-dc4e35ea49d6/9781536223422.jpg/400x700bb.jpg,"Social Studies,Books,Young Adult,History,Biography","“Black power!” wasn’t just a slogan in 1966. As YA novelist Kekla Magoon explores in this groundbreaking history, it was a revolutionary call to action. In the mid-20th century, Black men and women came together to challenge the centuries of systematic oppression that made up the American status quo, eventually morphing into an organized movement called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. Magoon’s rigorously researched book digs into that group’s accomplishments and the unconscionably unjust challenges it faced—which are all too often ignored in history books and pop culture. Magoon does more than give context to the images we’ve seen of beret-clad men with rifles. She details how the bulk of the party’s tireless efforts went into educating, feeding, and building Black communities. We were astounded by everything we learned about the Black Panthers’ true political ideals, and how the U.S. government still somehow justified suppressing them. Although it was written for young adults, <i>Revolution in Our Time</i> is required reading for anyone who wants to learn the true story behind one of America’s most notoriously misunderstood political movements.",0.0,0

Her findings were almost shockingly consistent. Overwhelmingly, mothers feel drained and alone in their worries about their children’s nutrition, experiencing near-constant stress about how to provide good food that’s healthy and tasty. Fielding-Singh follows four particular families across racial and class boundaries, and learns that whether the issue is getting overscheduled children to the dinner table or simply having enough food to eat, it’s clear that all families and children could use more empathy and support. If you’ve ever found yourself worrying about how to feed your kids a nutritious meal they’ll actually enjoy, <i>How the Other Half Eats</i> will leave you feeling heard.&#xa0;",5.0,1

British Canadian author Alison MacLeod explores the inspiring story behind author D. H. Lawrence’s brave and controversial novel <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i>. In 1928, Lawrence published the novel privately, knowing that its honest depiction of sexuality would prompt swift censorship. But it wasn’t until 1960—three decades after the author’s death—that the full text was finally made available to the public, prompting a British trial that ended in a groundbreaking win for the publisher. MacLeod deftly weaves factual accounts together with fictionalized characters and events, bringing to life the struggles around sensuality, class, and freedom of speech that marked both of these turbulent historical periods. <i>Tenderness</i> is a story about love—and the fight to celebrate it.",0.0,0
